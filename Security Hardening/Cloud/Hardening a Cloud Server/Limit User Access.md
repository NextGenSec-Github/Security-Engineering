# Limit User Access

## Create Separate User Accounts
Instead of using the root account for day-to-day tasks, create separate user accounts for each individual who needs access to the server. Assign appropriate permissions to these accounts based on the principle of least privilege, giving users only the access they need to perform their specific roles.

To create a new user account, you can use the adduser command:
```bash
sudo adduser username
```
Replace username with the desired username for the new account. Follow the prompts to set a password and additional information for the user.
