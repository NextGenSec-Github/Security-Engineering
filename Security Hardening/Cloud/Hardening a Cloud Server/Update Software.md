# Update Software

Ensure that all software packages on your server are up to date, including the operating system, web server, database server, and any other software installed. Use package managers like `yum` or `apt` to install updates regularly.

## Update Package Lists

Before updating the software packages, it's essential to update the package lists to fetch information about the latest available versions. You can do this using the following commands based on your Linux distribution:

For CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum check-update
```

For Ubuntu/Debian:
```bash
sudo apt update
```

## Upgrade Installed Packages 

Once the package lists are updated, you can proceed to upgrade the installed packages to their latest versions:

For CentOS/RHEL:
```bash
sudo yum upgrade
```

For Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt upgrade
```
