NOTE

# Customize the $EXTERNAL_NET and $HOME_NET variables according to your network configuration.
# These rules are basic examples and may generate false positives based on legitimate ARP responses. Fine-tune the rules based on your network's normal behavior.
# ARP spoofing detection may involve more sophisticated techniques, and these rules may need adjustment based on specific network deployment scenarios.
