NOTE
_____________
# Customize the $EXTERNAL_NET, $HTTP_SERVERS, $HTTP_PORTS, and $HOME_NET variables according to your network configuration.
# These rules are basic examples, and you may need to adjust them based on the specific web application and SSRF attack vectors you want to protect against.
# Regularly update and refine your rules based on the evolving threat landscape and changes in your network environment.
