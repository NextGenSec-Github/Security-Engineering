NOTE
_____________
# Customize the $EXTERNAL_NET, $HOME_NET, $HTTP_SERVERS, and $HTTP_PORTS variables according to your network configuration.
# These rules are basic examples and may generate false positives based on legitimate traffic. Fine-tune the rules based on your network's normal behavior and specific application context.
# Shellshock detection often involves more sophisticated techniques, and these rules may need adjustment based on specific application deployment scenarios.
