# Wireshark Display Filters
# =========================
# NOTE: What are Display Filters? Display filters in Wireshark are used to selectively display packets from a packet capture based on specific criteria. They allow you to focus on the packets that are relevant to your analysis and hide the rest. 
# Display filters can be based on various packet attributes such as protocol, source or destination IP address, port numbers, packet length, and more.
