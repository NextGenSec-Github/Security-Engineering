# What is Wireshark? üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Wireshark is a powerful open-source network protocol analyzer used for network troubleshooting, analysis, software and protocol development, and education. It allows users to capture and interactively browse the traffic running on a computer network.

## Features üõ†Ô∏è

- **Live Capture**: Wireshark can capture packets in real-time from networks and display them in a human-readable format.
- **Offline Analysis**: It can also analyze packet captures saved in various file formats, such as pcap.
- **Deep Inspection**: Wireshark can dive deep into captured packets, revealing details like protocols used, packet timings, and packet payloads.
- **Filtering**: Users can apply filters to focus on specific types of traffic, simplifying analysis.
- **VoIP Analysis**: It can decode and analyze Voice over IP (VoIP) calls, including SIP, RTP, and RTCP protocols.
- **Statistics**: Wireshark provides detailed statistics on network traffic, endpoints, and protocols.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available on multiple platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Usage Examples üöÄ

### 1. Capturing Packets

To capture packets live from a network interface, simply start Wireshark, select the desired interface, and click on the "Start" button. You will see packets being captured in real-time.

### 2. Analyzing Traffic

Once packets are captured, Wireshark displays them in a tabular format. You can select individual packets to view detailed information about each, including source and destination addresses, protocols used, and packet contents.

### 3. Filtering Traffic

Wireshark supports powerful filtering capabilities. For example, to filter HTTP traffic, you can use the filter expression `http`. This will display only packets related to HTTP communication.

### 4. VoIP Analysis

If you're troubleshooting VoIP issues, Wireshark can be invaluable. By capturing VoIP traffic and analyzing protocols like SIP and RTP, you can diagnose call quality problems, signaling issues, and more.

## Installation üì•

Wireshark can be downloaded and installed from its official website: [Wireshark.org](https://www.wireshark.org/). It's available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Conclusion üéâ

Wireshark is a versatile tool for network analysis and troubleshooting, offering a wide range of features for both beginners and advanced users. Whether you're diagnosing network performance issues, investigating security incidents, or learning about network protocols, Wireshark is an essential tool in your arsenal.
