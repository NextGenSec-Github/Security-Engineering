# What is Snort? 🐽

Snort is an open-source intrusion detection and prevention system (IDPS) that plays a crucial role in network security. Developed by Sourcefire, Snort is widely used for real-time traffic analysis and packet logging to detect and prevent a variety of security threats.

## Key Features

### 1. **Packet Sniffing:**
   - Snort captures and analyzes network packets in real-time, providing deep visibility into network traffic.

### 2. **Signature-Based Detection:**
   - Utilizes a signature-based detection engine to identify known patterns of malicious activity within the network traffic.

### 3. **Protocol Analysis:**
   - Analyzes network protocols at the application layer, allowing for the detection of suspicious behavior and anomalies.

### 4. **Logging and Alerting:**
   - Generates detailed logs of network activity and issues alerts when it identifies potential security threats based on predefined rules.

### 5. **Rule-Based Configuration:**
   - Snort uses a rule-based language to define specific conditions and actions for detecting and responding to network events.

### 6. **Flexible Deployment:**
   - Snort can be deployed in various modes, including sniffer mode, packet logger mode, and network intrusion detection system (NIDS) mode.

## Components of Snort

### 1. **Sniffer:**
   - Captures and logs network traffic for analysis.

### 2. **Packet Logger:**
   - Stores captured packets for later analysis.

### 3. **Detection Engine:**
   - Implements the signature-based detection mechanism to identify known threats.

### 4. **Preprocessors:**
   - Modify or preprocess packets before analysis, enhancing the accuracy of detection.

### 5. **Output Modules:**
   - Present alerts and logs in various formats, such as syslog, JSON, or database formats.

## Rule Structure

A Snort rule consists of the following components:

```plaintext
action protocol source_ip/source_port -> destination_ip/destination_port (options)
