## Sudo Execution History
All the commands that are run on a Linux host using sudo are stored in the auth log. We can use the `grep` utility to filter out only the required information from the auth log.

## Bash History (~/.bash_history)
The `~/.bash_history` file is a hidden file located in the user's home directory (~). It stores a history of commands that have been entered by the user in the Bash shell. Each line in the file typically represents a command that was executed in a previous session.

The Bash history file is managed by the shell itself, which automatically appends new commands to the file as they are entered. By default, the history file retains a certain number of recent commands, as specified by the `HISTSIZE` and `HISTFILESIZE` environment variables.

## Files Accessed Using Vim (~/.viminfo)
The /.viminfo file is a hidden file located in the user's home directory (~). It is used by the Vim text editor to store various information about Vim sessions, such as the history of commands, search patterns, marks, and other settings.
Here's an example of what you might find in a ~/.viminfo file:
```bash
# This is a Viminfo file!
'1000  1  4
>  % 
/Pattern
```

**In this example:**

- The first line is a comment indicating that this is a Viminfo file.
  
- The subsequent lines contain information about the Vim session, such as the last cursor position ('1000 1 4), the current file (%), and the last search pattern (/Pattern).

## Syslog (/var/log/syslog)
It contains messages generated by various system processes and services, providing a record of system events, errors, and activities.
Here's an example of what you might find in a /var/log/syslog file:
```bash
Apr 19 10:25:34 hostname kernel: [ 1234.567890] usb 1-1: new high-speed USB device number 2 using ehci-pci
Apr 19 10:30:12 hostname systemd[1]: Started Session 1234 of user john.
Apr 19 10:35:21 hostname sshd[5678]: Failed password for invalid user admin from 203.0.113.10 port 54321 ssh2
```
**In this example:**

- The first line shows a kernel message indicating the detection of a new USB device.
  
- The second line indicates the start of a user session by the systemd service manager.
  
- The third line logs a failed SSH login attempt.

The /var/log/syslog file serves as a central repository for system-level messages, providing administrators with a valuable tool for monitoring system health, troubleshooting issues, and diagnosing problems. It contains a wide range of information, including kernel messages, system startup/shutdown events, service status changes, authentication events, hardware events, and more. Since /var/log/syslog can grow quite large over time, it's common practice to rotate and compress log files periodically to conserve disk space and facilitate log management. Log rotation is typically handled by a system utility such as logrotate, which automatically archives and rotates log files based on predefined criteria, such as file size, age, or configuration changes.
