# What is OpenVAS?

## Introduction

OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System) is a free and open-source vulnerability scanning and management platform. It is designed to help organizations identify, assess, and mitigate security vulnerabilities in their IT infrastructure. OpenVAS is widely used by security professionals, system administrators, and organizations of all sizes to improve their overall cybersecurity posture.

## Key Features

### 1. Vulnerability Scanning

OpenVAS conducts comprehensive vulnerability scans of networks, systems, and applications to identify potential security weaknesses and misconfigurations.

**Example:** OpenVAS can scan a corporate network to detect outdated software versions, missing patches, and insecure configurations.

### 2. Network Discovery

OpenVAS automatically discovers and maps network assets, including hosts, services, and protocols, to provide a complete view of the organization's IT infrastructure.

**Example:** OpenVAS can discover all devices connected to a corporate network, including servers, workstations, printers, and network devices.

### 3. Vulnerability Detection

OpenVAS utilizes a vast database of known vulnerabilities, including Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVEs), to identify and classify security issues accurately.

**Example:** OpenVAS can detect vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and buffer overflows in web applications and services.

### 4. Configuration Auditing

OpenVAS assesses the configuration settings of network devices, operating systems, and applications to identify security weaknesses and compliance violations.

**Example:** OpenVAS can audit the configuration of firewalls, routers, and switches to ensure they adhere to security best practices and regulatory requirements.

### 5. Reporting

OpenVAS generates detailed reports that summarize the results of vulnerability scans, including identified vulnerabilities, risk ratings, and remediation recommendations.

**Example:** OpenVAS can produce PDF or HTML reports that highlight critical vulnerabilities, provide actionable insights, and track progress over time.

## Architecture

OpenVAS consists of several components, including:

- **OpenVAS Scanner:** Responsible for performing vulnerability scans and collecting scan results.
- **OpenVAS Manager:** Manages the scheduling, execution, and reporting of vulnerability scans.
- **OpenVAS Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA):** Provides a web-based interface for configuring scans, viewing scan results, and generating reports.
- **OpenVAS Command-Line Interface (CLI):** Allows users to interact with OpenVAS via the command line for advanced configuration and automation.
